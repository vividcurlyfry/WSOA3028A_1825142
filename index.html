            </h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">My name is Sadie Garner and I am a 21-year-old aspiring crime writer living
                in Johannesburg.
                I was born in Edenvale, Johannesburg. I originally wanted to be a policewoman, but I decided
                I
                was
                too
                small to be able to overpower criminals. I then figured that I should still try to solve
                crimes
                from
                afar through crime writing.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">I gained an interest in true crime when an acquaintance in my school was
                kidnapped in 1990.
                The
                girl was walking home from school when a man and wife in a van grabbed her. There was only
                one
                witness.
                Jan
                Burger was the chief detective on the case and solved it. The girlâ€™s body was found a month
                later.
                Burger is
                my role model. My goal in life is to be able to meet him and discuss every detail of his
                life.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">I have created this website in order to help solve what I call the "ABC
                Killings". Under "The Victims" you can find all the victims and information about their
                murders.
                Please contact me with any information you may have about these murders.</p>
