                Sadie Garner
            </h2>
            <p>My name is Sadie Garner and I am a 21-year-old aspiring crime writer living
                in Johannesburg.
                I was born in Edenvale, Johannesburg. I originally wanted to be a policewoman, but I decided
                I
                was
                too
                small to be able to overpower criminals. I then figured that I should still try to solve
                crimes
                from
                afar through crime writing.</p>

            <p>I gained an interest in true crime when an acquaintance in my school was
                kidnapped in 1990.
                The
                girl was walking home from school when a man and wife in a van grabbed her. There was only
                one
                witness.
                Jan
                Burger was the chief detective on the case and solved it. The girlâ€™s body was found a month
                later.
                Burger is
                my role model. My goal in life is to be able to meet him and discuss every detail of his
                life.</p>

            <p>I have created this website in order to help solve what I call the "Township
                Killer" Case. Under "Victims" you can find all the victims and information about the
                murders and kidnappings.
                Please contact me with any information you may have about these murders.</p>
