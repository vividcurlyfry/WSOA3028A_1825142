                    My name is Sadie Garner and I am a 21-year-old aspiring crime writer living in Johannesburg in
                    1995.
                    I was born in Edenvale, Johannesburg. I originally wanted to be a policewoman, but I decided I was
                    too
                    small to be able to overpower criminals. I then figured that I should still try to solve crimes from
                    afar through crime writing.<br><br>

                    I gained an interest in true crime when an acquaintance in my school was kidnapped in 1990. The
                    girl was walking home from school when a man and wife in a van grabbed her. There was only one
                    witness.
                    Jan
                    Burger was the chief detective on the case and solved it. The girlâ€™s body was found a month later.
                    Burger is
                    my role model. My goal in life is to be able to meet him and discuss every detail of his life.
                    <br><br>

                    I have created this website in order to help solve what I call the "ABC
                    Killings". Under "The Victims" you can find all the victims and information about their murders.
                    Please contact me with any information you may have about these murders.
