        <article>My name is Sadie Garner and I am a 21-year-old aspiring crime writer living in Johannesburg in 1995.
            I was born in Edenvale, Johannesburg. I originally wanted to be a policewoman, but I decided I was too
            small to be able to overpower criminals. I then figured that I should still try to solve crimes from
            afar through crime writing. I have created this website in order to help solve what I call the "ABC
            Killings". Under "The ABC Killer" you can find all the victims and information about their murders. Please
            contact me with any information.

            I gained an interest in true crime when an acquaintance in my school was kidnapped in 1990. The
            girl was walking home from school when a man and wife in a van grabbed her. There was only one witness. Jan
            Burger was the chief detective on the case and solved it. The girlâ€™s body was found a month later. Burger is
            my role model. My goal in life is to be able to meet him and discuss every detail of his life. </article>
