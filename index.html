            </h2>
            My name is Sadie Garner and I am a 21-year-old aspiring crime writer living in Johannesburg.
            I was born in Edenvale, Johannesburg. I originally wanted to be a policewoman, but I decided
            I
            was
            too
            small to be able to overpower criminals. I then figured that I should still try to solve
            crimes
            from
            afar through crime writing.<br><br>

            I gained an interest in true crime when an acquaintance in my school was kidnapped in 1990.
            The
            girl was walking home from school when a man and wife in a van grabbed her. There was only
            one
            witness.
            Jan
            Burger was the chief detective on the case and solved it. The girlâ€™s body was found a month
            later.
            Burger is
            my role model. My goal in life is to be able to meet him and discuss every detail of his
            life.
            <br><br>

            I have created this website in order to help solve what I call the "ABC
            Killings". Under "The Victims" you can find all the victims and information about their
            murders.
            Please contact me with any information you may have about these murders.
