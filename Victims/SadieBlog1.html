<body onload="LoadBlogPost('Prioritising White Children being Kidnapped Over Black Children',`<p style = &quot margin-bottom: 1rem;&quot>Ask anyone if they know the name “Micaela Hunter”. I will bet money that they will immediately describe the story of a baby being kidnapped from a hospital by a woman who pretended she was her child for two years. Now ask anyone if they know the name “Nelly Khumalo”. I will bet more money and say that they have no idea who this girl is. Ask them about Vincent Khoza. Sheronisa Dladla. Nhlanhla Visser. Terence Motaung. Pinimidzai Maseko. Pamela Njandi. These are all children that are being kidnapped in townships all over Johannesburg. No one is talking about it. Least of all, the police. They have chalked up the kidnapping of children ages 8 to 15 on drug and gang violence. Five of the eight children have been found. Unfortunately, they have been found brutally murdered. The media has barely mentioned these children. These names need to be shouted from the rooftops. Innocent children are missing, and no one is doing anything about it.</p>`+
`<p style = &quot margin-bottom: 1rem;&quot>I will be using the platform to bring light on the kidnapping and possible murder of these children. I will need your help. I have many theories that I am hoping, with your help, can be fleshed out. I will delve deeper into the information of these 8 kidnappings. THE POLICE AND MEDIA NEED TO PAY ATTENTION.</p>`
