            they will immediately describe the story of a baby being kidnapped from a hospital by a woman who pretended
            she was her child for two years. Now ask anyone if they know the name “Nelly Khumalo”. I will bet more money
            and say that they have no idea who this girl is. <a

            <strong>Eight Missing Children.</strong>
            Nelly Khumalo, age 14, went missing on the 12th December in the township of Tembisa, Johannesburg. She did
            not return home from school that day. In the same month, on the 28th of December, Terrence Motaung, age 14
            went missing in the Alexandra township. He did not return home from being with his friends for the day. Both
            sets of parents reported their children missing

            <strong>Bodies Found.</strong>
            The first body to be found was Pamela’s body. Her body was found in Soweto. The method of killing was a shot
            to the head. Her body was placed in a sexually explicit manner, despite there being no sign of sexual
            assault. This is interesting because it means the murder was not sexually motivated, but rather purely evil.

            <strong>One Killer.</strong>
            There are a few reasons I have theorised that these killings are all the result of one person. There is a
            distinct pattern occurring within these killings. I have created a timeline to show the order of the
            killings
