<body
    onload="LoadBlogPost('Sheronisa\'\s Body Found',`<p>In my last post, I predicted that Sheronisaâ€™s body will be found in Tembisa. Sadly, this turned out to be true. This could just be a coincidence, but this could also prove my theory. Her body was horrifically brutalised. Once again, all identifying features like the face and hands were left in tact. She had been stabbed 32 times, and her body was sexually assaulted post-mortem. This shows that the killer was incredibly violent. This could be because he waited a long time in between Vincent and Sheronisa. Perhaps he was frustrated. I did predict that this killing would be very violent. This man may think he is unstoppable, but what he does not understand is that there are people out there who are picking up on his patterns. He will be caught.</p><p>There are still no witnesses or any clues for these murders. The media is not talking about it, and the police seem to be ignoring the links between these killings. If you are able to share this website with your friends and family, this would help get this case out there. I will keep you updated as more news comes.</p>`,'','/WSOA3028A_1825142/Victims/SadieBlogs/SadieBlog4-OneKiller.html','#'); generateNav()">
