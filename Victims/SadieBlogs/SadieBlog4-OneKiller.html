    onload="LoadBlogPost('One Killer',`<p>There are a few reasons I have theorised that these killings are all the result of one person. There is a distinct pattern occurring within these killings. I have created a timeline to show the order of the killings:</p><p><img class=&quot pictureRow &quot src=&quot /WSOA3028A_1825142/Theory/Timeline.png &quot alt= &quot Timeline of the Township Murders &quot height=500rem></p><p>There is also a pattern with where the killings took place and where the bodies were found:</p><p><img class=&quot pictureRow &quot src=&quot /WSOA3028A_1825142/Theory/Towns.png &quot alt= &quot Picture Showing where people were killed in the Township Murders &quot height=300rem></p><p>Now, I am going to take some creative liberty and tell the story that I think has occured here. This is simply just my theory that I have put together using the clues the police have released. </p><p>These murders were heavily premeditated. This man has a meticulous plan. There are 4 boys and 4 girls that have been murdered. The murderer murders a boy and a girl of a certain age. This must be some sick fantasy he has. </p><p>The man started in Tembisa. He killed Nelly first, who was 14. He spent 16 days searching for his next victim, to complete his first cycle. He travelled to Alexandra, 30 minutes away, to make it less obvious that multiple killings were happening. He then found Terrence. According to the state of Terrence’s body, the murder was brutal and quick. He also did not have time to properly “plan” the dumping of the body, as Terrence’s body was just thrown on the side of the road. Perhaps he felt someone was close to catching him. </p><p>A month later, the man strikes again. He targets children in townships. It is my thought that the man must be a black man, as it is unlikely that a white person would go unnoticed in a township. No witnesses have come up in any cases as of late. This could mean that the man is someone who seems trustworthy, that the children are familiar with. The man strikes in Soweto, 29km from Alexandra. This is a 40-minute drive. Pinimidzai Maseko was killed, age 15. His next step was to find a boy, age 15, to kill. He makes his way back to Tembisa, and spotted Kgomotso. He spoke to Kgomotso first, stating he had a business opportunity for him and that they should meet up later. This is one of the facts of the case that highlight the premeditation of the killings. He kills Kgomotso.</p><p>He then waits another month to begin the next cycle of killings. He spots two people, a boy and a girl, of the same age. The perfect victims. He is in Tembisa again. He shoots Pamela and brutalises Nhlanhla. He has time to dump these bodies, as he does not need to murder anyone for another month. This is his pattern. Kill, wait approximately 2 weeks, kill another person of the same age and opposite gender, then wait a month before starting the cycle again. Now, he didn’t need to wait 2 weeks before completing the 13 year old stage of the cycle. He disposed of these bodies very meticulously, planning how he wanted the police to find them.</p><p>He then strikes again, in Tembisa. Tembisa, Alexandra, Soweto. This is the pattern he follows. Vincent, 8 years old, his youngest victim yet, is snatched in broad daylight. He is then brutalised. He has managed to get away with these murders for 4 months, so he is reckless with taking Vincent. This child’s murder is particularly violent. He is feeling power hungry and over confident. He moves quickly to Alexandra and dumps Vincent’s body. This shows that immediately after killing, he is on the prowl for his next victim.</p><p>His next victim is Sheronisa Dladla. She is also snatched in broad daylight. She completes the pair of 8 year old victims. He waited a month between Vincent and Sheronisa, not his usual two weeks. Perhaps he could not find the right victim. I suspect that this killing with unfortunately be particularly violent because of this.</p><p>This man is a very meticulous, power hungry and evil person. He kills in Tembisa, dumps that body in Alexandra, kills in Alexandra, dumps that body in Soweto, etc. My opinion on this is that he thinks this will cause police to take longer to identify bodies and pinpoint where and when the killings are happening. Interestingly, the faces and fingerprints are left unharmed on the victims. This shows that he WANTS the victims to be identified. These are not crimes of passion; these are sick fantasies that this man is living out. The man travels across Johannesburg with bodies in his car, making 40 minute trips without anyone questioning him. This shows he presents as a normal person. He was also able to convince Kgomosto that he had a business opportunity for him, which could mean he dresses well and is eloquent. Kgomotso was 15 years old and a smart boy. This shows that the man manipulated him.</p><p>Following the pattern Nelly and Kgomotso’s body will be found in Alexandra and Pinimidzai and Sheronisa’s body will be found in Tembisa. It also does not seem like there is any rhyme or reason for the choice of ages that the murderer is killing. He does not seem to repeat ages or go in any order. His next victim will be in Tembisa and their age will be different from any of the other victims.</p><p><strong>Why are there no leads?</strong></p><p>The police have yet to take anyone in for questioning. While the police are taking their time, this man could be planning to kill more children. The fact that there are NO witnesses to these crimes show that this man is smart and meticulous. He will strike again. </p><p>Everyone, please keep up to date with crimes going on around Townships, particularly in Johannesburg. I know the police will not be paying that much attention. </p><p>Remember: Kgomotso, a smart 15 year old boy, was manipulated by this man. He probably dresses well, is eloquent and will charm you. He is probably hiding amongst us, blending in perfectly. Please teach your children about stranger danger, as the police have done nothing of the sort. This man is not your typical criminal type. He is very smart and very dangerous. Please, please, PLEASE let me know if you have any information. I will post it on this page and we can force the police to listen.</p>`,'','/WSOA3028A_1825142/Victims/SadieBlogs/SadieBlog3-BodiesFound.html','#'); generateNav()">
