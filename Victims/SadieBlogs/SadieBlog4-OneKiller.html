    onload="LoadBlogPost('One Killer',`<p style = &quot margin-bottom: 1rem;&quot>There are a few reasons I have theorised that these killings are all the result of one person. There is a distinct pattern occurring within these killings. I have created a timeline to show the order of the killings:</p><p style = &quot margin-bottom: 1rem;&quot>There is also a pattern with where the killings took place and where the bodies were found:</p><p style = &quot margin-bottom: 1rem;&quot>Now, I am going to take some creative liberty and tell the story I think has happened here. This is simply just my theory that I have put together using the clues the police have released.</p><p style = &quot margin-bottom: 1rem;&quot>These murders were heavily premeditated. This man has a meticulous plan. There are 4 boys and 4 girls that have been murdered. The murderer murders a boy and a girl of a certain age. This must be some sick fantasy he has. </p><p style = &quot margin-bottom: 1rem;&quot>TThe man started in Tembisa. He killed Nelly first, who was 14. He spent 16 days searching for his next victim, to complete his first cycle. He then found Terrence. According to the state of Terrence’s body, the murder was brutal and quick. He also did not have time to properly “plan” the dumping of the body, as Terrence’s body was just thrown on the side of the road. Perhaps he felt someone was close to catching him. </p><p style = &quot margin-bottom: 1rem;&quot>A month later, the man strikes again. He targets children in townships. It is my thought that the man must be a black man, as it is unlikely that a white person would go unnoticed in a township. No witnesses have come up in any cases as of late. This could mean that the man is someone who seems trustworthy, that the children are familiar with. The man strikes in Alexandra, 16km from Tembisa. This is a 30-minute drive. </p><p style = &quot margin-bottom: 1rem;&quot>Terrence Motaung’s body was the next to be found. He died in a similar manner to Nhlanhla. He had been stabbed 4 times. There was once again evidence of sexual assault. His body was dumped on the side of the road. This murder seemed careless and unplanned. Without the evidence of sexual assault, the police would have perceived it as a crime of passion. His body was also found in Soweto..</p>`,'<cite>[1] J.
