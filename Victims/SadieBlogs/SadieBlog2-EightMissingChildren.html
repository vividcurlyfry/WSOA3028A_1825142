She did not return home from school that day. In the same month, on the 28th of December, Terrence Motaung, age 14 went missing in the Alexandra township. He did not return home from being with his friends for the day. Both sets of parents reported their children missing the same day. These cases were not treated as missing children/kidnappings. Statistics show that 80% of missing children are runaways in South Africa [1]. I suppose that’s why the police decided they didn’t need to investigate that much. Nelly’s parents were adamant that their daughter would not runaway. The family has 3 daughters, of which Nelly is the eldest. Her parents said that she was very close with her sisters and would never leave them. Terrence’s friends stated that he left one of their houses around 5:30pm. It should have taken Terrence about 15 minutes to walk home safely. His parents stated he was a very happy child in their home and had no reason to run away. These children are also old enough that they would not get lost.</p><p style = &quot margin-bottom: 1rem;&quot>Then, in Soweto, 15 year old Pinimidzai Maseko went missing. This was on the 29th of January.  She was working at a local store when she said she was taking a break. She did not return home or to the business. This was in broad daylight. Pinimidzai had fought with her parents earlier in the week, so they assumed she had run away. She was only reported missing a week later. Kgomotso Ndhlovu was then reported missing on the 13th of February in Tembisa, almost exactly 2 months after Nelly went missing. His friends said he was meeting up with an unknown person for a business opportunity and he did not return from that meeting.</p><p style = &quot margin-bottom: 1rem;&quot>Alexandra then had two cases of missing children on the same day. Nhlanhla Visser and Pamela Njandi, both age 13, went missing on the 18th of March. The two were rumoured to be in a romantic relationship. A friend of Pamela stated that Pamela’s mother did not approve of Nhlanhla’s relationship with her daughter. All of Pamela’s friends suspected that the two had ran away together, as Pamela had threatened this before. They were reported missing the same day they disappeared, by Nhlanhla’s family. It was discovered that Nhlanhla had been involved in distributing small amounts of marijuana to his friends. The police deemed the child to have gotten more involved in some drug trade, which resulted in a deal gone wrong. They did not investigate further.</p><p style = &quot margin-bottom: 1rem;&quot>A mother living in Tembisa was then faced with a parent’s worst fear. Her eight-year-old child, Vincent Khoza, went missing suddenly one afternoon. He was playing outside when the mother turned her back, only for her to turn around again and for him to be gone. She reported him missing immediately. This was on the 19th of April, on Good Friday. Because of the public holiday, the cops did not begin an investigation on the Friday. The official search for the boy only commenced the following Thursday. The most recent victim was Sheronisa Dladla, on the 5th of May. She wanted to buy sweets at a local tuck shop and never returned. Her family reported her missing the same day. The police conducted a search but nothing has come up as of late. She went missing in Soweto.</p>`,'<cite>[1] J. Gerardy, &quotMissing kids crisis,&quot 5 January 2008. [Online].
