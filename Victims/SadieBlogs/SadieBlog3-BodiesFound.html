    onload="LoadBlogPost('Bodies Found',`<p style = &quot margin-bottom: 1rem;&quot>The first body to be found was Pamela’s body. Her body was found in Soweto. The method of killing was a shot to the head. Her body was placed in a sexually explicit manner, despite there being no sign of sexual assault. This is interesting because it means the murder was not sexually motivated, but rather purely evil. The body was posed post-mortem, which shows this was not a passion killing, but rather a premeditated murder. The police have found no leads as of yet. The family has no idea as to who would have committed this crime.</p><p style = &quot margin-bottom: 1rem;&quot>The next body found was Nhlanhla’s. This body was found a few days after Pamela’s in Soweto. Unfortunately, there were signs of sexual assault with this victim. His body was found fully clothed. Initially it seemed that there the body was not moved post-mortum. Upon further investigation, it was found that the victim had been posed to look “unposed”. There were ligature marks found on the wrists and ankles of the victim, indicating he was tied up for a period of time. Nhlanhla’s family also have no idea who would do this to their son.</p><p style = &quot margin-bottom: 1rem;&quot>The police have theorised that the murderer shot the girl, then forced the boy to go with him. They suspect that the boy was tied up and sexually assaulted. He was then stabbed four times. Both of these bodies were found 2 weeks after the disappearance of the teens. The police did say that they died shortly after being abducted.</p><p style = &quot margin-bottom: 1rem;&quot>The posing of Pamela could indicate that the assailant was trying to hint at the sexual assault of the girl, even though this was not present. This could be an attempt at misleading the police. Another attempt at misleading the police was the “unposed”  pose of Nhlanhla. This could indicate that the murderer was trying to hide the evidence of sexual assault.</p><p style = &quot margin-bottom: 1rem;&quot>The police still believe this was a drug related crime, for some reason. A drug related crime, in my opinion, would not be this violent and premediated. The sexual assault is also highly unusual for a drug deal gone wrong.</p><p style = &quot margin-bottom: 1rem;&quot>Tragically, Vincent Khoza’s body was found in Alexandra, brutalised. This crime was particularly violent. The boy had been stabbed up to 13 times, with evidence of sexual assault. I will spare you more details. The body was found in a trash bag. There was no evidence of the boy being tied up. The police have stated that the body was moved post-mortem. The police stated that the Vincent was alive merely 10 hours before being found. He had been missing for 3 days.</p><p style = &quot margin-bottom: 1rem;&quot>Terrence Motaung’s body was the next to be found. He died in a similar manner to Nhlanhla. He had been stabbed 4 times. There was once again evidence of sexual assault. His body was dumped on the side of the road. This murder seemed careless and unplanned. Without the evidence of sexual assault, the police would have perceived it as a crime of passion. His body was also found in Soweto..</p>`,''); generateNav()">
