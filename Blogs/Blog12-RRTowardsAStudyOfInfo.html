It asks the question: Since there is an access to technology anywhere nowadays, is there difference in how some geographies access these technologies? The paper analysed three different areas to answer this question.</p><h3>Geographies of access and enablement</h3><p>The distribution of internet access across countries is uneven. For example, Asia contains 42% of the world’s internet users. Most countries in Europe have 80% or more internet penetration, meaning 80% or more of the population have access to the internet. In contrast, “over 20 sub-Saharan African countries have an internet penetration of less than 10%”. The access to internet has a direct correlation to the access to information. If a person does not have access to the internet, they do not have access to all the information present on the internet.</p>  <p>Another issue of internet access across countries is the cost of broadband. The paper states that the relative affordability of broadband is the biggest issue. For example, the cost of broadband in Europe may be expensive, but being able to afford broadband takes a few hours of work. An astonishing line in the paper explains that one year of a broadband subscription costs the equivalent of 50 years of work.</p><h3>Geographies of participation</h3><p style = &quot font-style: italic; &quot>Domain Names</p><p>Domain names are measured as an indication of content produced. The paper analysed how many domain names are registered in each country. The majority of domain names are registered in Europe or North America. In America, there are approximately 1 domain name for every three internet users, where Asia has one registered domain name for 40 internet users. This is interesting as Asia has the largest population of internet users. Analysing these numbers show that just because a country has a large internet population, there may not be a large amount of domain registrations. This shows that Europe and America are the largest producers of digital content. There is a large discrepancy between the intake of information and the production of information.</p><p style = &quot font-style: italic; &quot>GitHub</p><p> GitHub is a code hosting service that programmers use to publish code. North America and Europe count for a third of all GitHub users. The Middle East, North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa are home to fewer than 1% of GitHub users. This shows that the contribution of developing programmes is disproportionality based in North America and Europe. Code development does not take place as much in the Middle East and Africa. </p><p style = &quot font-style: italic; &quot>Wikipedia</p><p>Wikipedia is the worlds largest and most used encyclopaedia. Looking at Wikipedia’s data gives a good idea as to how information is shared. Wikipedia allows anyone with an internet connection to make a contribution. Once again, North America is one of the largest contributors to Wikipedia. Other large contributors include Germany, the United Kingdom and France. The paper states that Africa’s contributions are so low that Hong Kong alone contributes more than the whole continent combined.</p><h3>Geographies of representation</h3><p>The paper quantified the number of Google searches for each country name. The United States once again has the largest number of mentions in Google’s index. The paper then quantified the information available for each country on OpenStreetMap. The United States and Europe topped this information, with California containing more content on the app than the entire continent of Africa. The content in the Freebase database and Geonames was analysed. It showed that the United States has the largest concentration in Freebase with 45%. Geonames has more content for the United States alone than the whole continent of Asia.</p><h2>Why Does It Matter?</h2><p>From the data present, it can be seen that there are clear issues present in the sharing of information. Even today, when I was browsing the internet, I came across a question asking where I am from in the world. The options were Europe, America and Global. This is a prime example of the internet catering to first world countries. There are not just small differences, these are differences that create are shocking. This needs to be fixed.</p><p>It can be seen that countries that are impoverished are most affected by the digital divide. “Information is critical in facilitating productivity” [1]. If third world countries cannot get access to information, they cannot be as productive as first world countries. This assists in creating more of an economic divide amongst countries. The bridging of this digital divide will bridge communication gaps between different cultures. The illiterate in third-world countries will benefit from increased access to information.</p><p>It is important for governments to focus on bridging the digital divide in order to create equal opportunity for all.</p>`, '<cite>[1] C.
