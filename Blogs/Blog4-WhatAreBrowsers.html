    onload="LoadBlogPost('What are Browsers and URLs, and how do they work?','<p>Browsers are software that allow for websites to be displayed to users. Browsers allow for people to navigate through the internet. Browser functionality consists of four major sections: Fetch, Process, Display, Storage [1]. A browser will use a URL to fetch resources from the internet. It is important that the user has a good enough network to fetch data. The browser will then process this data. For example, code will be executed, and optimisation will occur. This data will then be displayed to the user using the User Interface. &quotThe User Interface (UI) communicates with other subsystems within the browser to display content and act accordingly&quot [1]. The browser will then store a small amount of data in order to make the userâ€™s experience faster and more convenient, such as storing what websites a user has interacted with in a previous session</p>'+
'<p>URLs are used to navigate on a browser. URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. You enter a URL into the browser, and a website will load if that URL exists. A URL has the name of the protocol needed to access the site, as well as the IP address or domain name [2]. Other parts that a URL can include are the path, which refers to &quotthe file or location on the web server&quot [2] and a fragment, which is an internal reference to a page in the website. URLs can be shortened. A redirect page with a shortened URL can be used in order to make it easier for people to access a page, although this may cause the page to become susceptible to malware.</p>', '<cite> [1] A. S.
