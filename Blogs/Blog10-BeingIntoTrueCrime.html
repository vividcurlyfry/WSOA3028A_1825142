    onload="LoadBlogPost('Being &quotInto &quot True Crime But Also Believing All Cops Are Bastards',` <p>I have reached a cross roads. For this website, I am creating a character that is an investigative journalist. She wanted to be a cop. In this recent political climate, with the Black Lives Matter movement, I have started to believe that ACAB (All Cops Are Bastards). This is very similar to the All Men Are Trash movement in my opinion. There are some good men, but all men have the capacity to be “trash”. I am one of those crazy white girls who are obsessed with true crime. I listen to true crime podcasts, watch true crime shows, the like. When following these stories, the police seem to be the Good Guys. A typical villain versus hero story. </p><p>I used to fully support the police and what they stand for, but now I realise this is a flawed approach. This is why I have decided that Sadie will be wanting to take matters into her own hands and discuss the inequalities in the justice system. I think this will highlight my beliefs more. When looking at many of my favourite true crime cases, there are so many examples of the cops being completely and utterly useless. Murders get out of prison and kill again. This is because of the broken justice system.</p> <p  >A basic google search turned up the injustice in the South Africa in the persecution of black and white killers. Sibusiso Mpungose, a black man who killed his four children, has gotten four life terms in prison. Michael White, a white man who killed his pregnant wife 15 years ago is now allowed unsupervised prison leave. He needs “family time” with his grown up daughter, who witnessed the murder. HOW can you say that one person gets four life sentences and another gets unsupervised family time? It’s so frustrating. This is an example of dangerous killer being put away for life, a win in my opinion, and a white man getting FAMILY TIME. He stabbed his pregnant wife to death and gets FAMILY TIME. God help me.</p><p>This could just be me trying to rationalise having a certain belief while also trying to still be interested in true crime. I have never faced any experienced any discrimination from the police, and perhaps that is why I read these stories. I am hoping that making Sadie take matters in her own hands and fight for the attention from the media and police will highlight my beliefs. I think the justice system and the police need to change in this country.</p>`, '','/WSOA3028A_1825142/Blogs/Blog8-ActuallyFiguringItOut.html','/WSOA3028A_1825142/Blogs/Blog11-WireframesAndColour.html'); generateNav()">
