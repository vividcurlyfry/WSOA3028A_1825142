                    When trying to make up a serial killer, I am trying not to be too insensitive. The ABC Killer (Moses
                    Sithole) is the biggest serial killer in South Africa, who murdered at least 38 people. He was
                    called the ABC Killer because he killed in Atteridgeville, Boksburg and Cleveland. Tamsen de Beer (a
                    journalist) was called by Sithole. Sithole identified himself as the ABC Killer and had to tell her
                    where a body was to confirm he was the killer. Sithole murdered women with their own clothes, which
                    was a very clear Modus Operandi. He told women that he had job prospects for them and would lead
                    them away. This is an interesting story and initially I was going to put myself in the place of de
                    Beer, but decided against it. I want to be able to have some creative freedom when creating this
                    killer. I still want this website to be from a crime writer who helps solve a crime. An obvious
                    example of this is Michelle Mcnamara, a crime writer who wrote a book about the East Area Rapist,
                    who she later coined the Golden State Killer. She helped essentially solve the case by creating the
                    name Golden State Killer which created more publicity for the unsolved crime. I want to have Sadie
                    Garner be a writer like Michelle Mcnamara who helps coin the name of the killer. Another
                    Johannesburg killer is Cedric Maake. His case is super interesting because initially, two criminal
                    profiles were created for him because of the different MOs. He shot women, bludgeoned couples to
                    death with rocks and killed tailors with hammers. The two different profiles were eventually
                    connected when evidence began to overlap. I think I want to create a killer with no clear MO. I also
                    want Sadie Garner to coin the name and make the connection between initially unconnected cases.
