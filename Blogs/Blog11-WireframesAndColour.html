Then, I wanted Sadie to be a victim of the serial killer she was hunting. In the end, I decided this was really trashy and insensitive as a story line. I thought I should make it more realistic, which is why I changed the idea for the victims but have mostly keep the idea for the home page.</p><p> Small features I have added to increase user experience include: <p><img src=&quot /WSOA3028A_1825142/Theory/Menu.png &quot alt=&quot Screenshot of website. &quot height=80rem></p> </p><p>When the user hovers over the menu, they will see these lines appearing to show that they have highlighted and can click on those links. The dropdown menu also highlights to show which menu item is selected.</p><p><p><img src=&quot /WSOA3028A_1825142/Theory/Banner.png &quot alt=&quot Screenshot of website. &quot height=40rem></p>This banner was added as a PSA, which increases the user experience and immersion in the fictional world. I have changed the red string idea to a list of blog posts that Sadie has. This is so that it is easier to view all the information and so the idea is not as insensitive.</p><p>Here is the Colour Scheme for my website: <p><img src=&quot /WSOA3028A_1825142/Theory/Color.png &quot alt=&quot Picture of a color scheme. &quot height=300rem></p> </p>`, '', 'Blogs/Blog11-WireframesAndColour.html'); generateNav()">
