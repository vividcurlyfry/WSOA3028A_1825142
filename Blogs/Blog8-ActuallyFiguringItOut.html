    onload="LoadBlogPost('Actually Figuring It Out','HUGE IDEA! I finally figured out what I want to do with the creative side of the site. When watching the show Mindhunter, a large part of season two was about the Child Atlanta murders. 28 people, mostly children and adolescents, were murdered. This happened in the late 70s and early 80s. I donâ€™t know a lot of details of the real case, but the show was interesting and has inspired me. I think this will be far easier to write a story about and base it in Johannesburg especially. The issue with the cases is that the police basically didnâ€™t care about these missing black children. The murders were written off as drug or gang related and dismissed. It wasnâ€™t put together that there was a serial killer at large until a few months later, I think. This is a clear example of the racism that is and was present in the police force. I think this can largely be applied to a story set in South Africa. There will be many children that are dying, the deaths of which werenâ€™t connected until much later on. This will still tie in to what I want where Sadie links that there is a serial killer present, but also highlight racism in the country. I have used an AI generator to get pictures of young black children to be the victims and I have made up some names. I will come up with a story for each victim and Sadie will be the one who theorises that there is one person behind all this. I feel much happier about this idea as I will not be talking about real killings. I had a fear that when talking about the ABC killings that I was not going to do the story justice. The most important part of the story will be the fact that the police are doing nothing to solve the case. I would also like to compare the publicity of kidnappings of white children in South Africa to these made up cases. More research needs to be done in order to create a proper narrative.', ''); generateNav()">
