<body onload="LoadBlogPost('Reading Reflection: Library of Babel - Jorge Luis Borges','<p>The Library of Babel speaks of a fictional library that contains every possible combination of the &quot25&quot symbols in the English alphabet. This would mean that every book that could ever possibly be written is contained in this library, nonsensical or otherwise. My first impression of the reading was that I was quite confused by the concept. This was because of the serious and academic tone of the paper, along with the footnotes. For a moment I thought that this Library of Babel did really exist and that I was missing out on something. Then I realised that the concept of infinity itself is a blur and there is most definitely not enough trees left in this world to create this. Needless to say, I enjoyed the paper. </p>' +
'<p>It could be said that the internet is the Library of Babel, and I both agree and disagree. The internet can definitely seem endless, replicating the infiniteness of the Library. My thought is that no one would make a completely nonsensical website, or two different websites that differ by one letter, or three, or four, or an infinite number. Then again, people have been creating &quotmeme&quot and nonsensical websites for years. So, there could perhaps be a finite version of the Library of Babel online. Another argument that the Library could be created is human nature. The reading about the Library of Babel exists, for everyone to read. Would that not mean that a group of dedicated people could spend their lives trying to create the Library of Babel online? Algorithms can be used to create the Library. Although, it would be impossible to create infinite amounts of storage, there just aren’t enough resources on earth. Unless in the future inventors create a way to clone resources.</p>' +
'<p>In the reading, the concept of a Book-Man is brought up. This is a person who has found a book that is the perfect combination of all other books, and once they have read it they have risen to a god-like state. This concept interests me. Could creating the Library of Babel inevitably lead us to the meaning of life? Would we even realise that this book describes such a thing? One would probably assume that it’s fiction. Perhaps generating an infinite amount of random content could lead humans to the answers to questions we never even thought to ask. </p>',''
