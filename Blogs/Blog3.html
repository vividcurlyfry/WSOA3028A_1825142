<body onload="LoadBlogPost('Reading Reflection: Alan Turing - Computing Machinery and Intelligence','Alan Turing is attempting to answer the question, “Can machines think?”. Turing thought that this question could be more easily answered by asking “Can a machine fool a person into believing it is human?”. To answer this question, Turing formulated “The Imitation Game”. This game involves three people. One person (the interrogator) would be asking the other two people questions to figure out which of them is a woman. Turing wants to know if the woman can be replaced by a machine and fool the interrogator. Machines are thought of as digital computers in this case. An interesting point that Turing brought up was that in order to fool the interrogator, the machine would need to make mistakes. If the interrogator were to ask the two “people” to solve a maths sum and the machine responded immediately with the correct answer, it would be clear that it is the machine. Therefore, the machine would have to learn what would make it seem the most human. Turing asked invented this game in 1950. The reading could be interpreted to describe Artificial Intelligence (AI). The first program that could be considered AI was created in 1955 [1]. In 2020, the likes of Sophia The Robot exist. In 2020, the Imitation game could arguably be won by the machine that is Artificial Intelligence. Machine learning could be a key aspect of winning the Imitation Game. A machine that learns what caused it to lose the game and changes that could win the game easily. It could learn the mistakes it needs to make in order to convince the interrogator as well as what other humans have said to make it seem more humanlike. As of 2019, the Imitation Game has not been won by an AI[2].'
