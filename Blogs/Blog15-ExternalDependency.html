    onload="LoadBlogPost('My External Dependency Implementation',` <p>For my external dependency or framework I chose to implement an email sending function. I used the code from <a href=&quot https://smtpjs.com/v3/smtp.js &quot>https://smtpjs.com/v3/smtp.js</a> and the encryption service from <a href = &quot https://smtpjs.com/ &quot>https://smtpjs.com/</a> to encrypt my email’s username and password. This dependency was easy to use and effective.</p><h3> Creative and Theory</h3><p> Creatively, the storyline of the site is enhanced with this dependency. Sadie is keeping the followers of the site updated on a case that directly affects them. Whenever a new blog post is added, a person who has subscribed to the email list will be notified. The real world and the fictional website is effectively linked as I can even say that the email is sent from Sadie’s address. I have added a blog post that a person would see if there was an update in the case. This blog post confirms theories from previous blog posts and reminds people of the suspect Sadie has profiled. </p><p>Theoretically, this shows how the internet has made a difference in the True Crime world.<a href = &quot http://truecrimediary.com/ &quot>True Crime Diary</a> was a HUGE inspiration for this blog. Michelle McNamara also had a blog to keep people updated about her work with the Golden State Killer. The internet and technology has completely changed the way crimes are both committed and solved. Michelle McNamara’s blog has the ability to subscribe to an RSS feed, which would allow for users to keep updated in the same way I have intended with the email system. </p><h3>Technical</h3><p>This dependency was quick and easy to use. I created a SMTP server using <a href = &quot https://smtpjs.com/ &quot>smtpjs.com/</a>, then encrypted my username and password. I then used the code provided on that site to easily send an email to a user. I used an input field to allow for users to enter their email. When the button is pressed, an email is automatically sent out. It shows what an update of a blog post would look like.</p><p>Realistically, I would design the page so that the blog posts would be entered dynamically. Then, when “Sadie” adds a new post, a script would automatically send out an pre-formatted email. The site would ask a user if they would like to sign up for email alerts. These emails would be stored in a database. The user would also be able to unsubscribe from the emails. This would mean their email was removed from the database.<h3>Alternatives</h3><p>Some alternatives to the email system include an RSS feed or a push notification system. I also attempted to use the Google’s SMTP server to send emails, but found it was quicker and easier to use the SMTP.js dependency. The Gmail server required the creation of an API key and an OAuth 2.0 Client ID. This could be done through the Google Developers Console. I found there were a lot more steps to get this working as opposed to the smtp.js file.</p><p>I think this external dependency enhanced the websites creatively, theoretically and technically.</p>`, '','/WSOA3028A_1825142/Blogs/Blog14-RRCriminalMachineLearning.html','#'); generateNav()">
