                    A website in 2020 should be accessible to all types of people. By accessible, I mean that the people
                    with disabilities are not excluded when accessing a website. Websites should be easy and convenient
                    for all people to use. People who are colour-blind, dyslexic, blind etc. should be able to use a
                    site with ease. Businesses can even benefit from making their sites accessible as they are allowing
                    more people to be able to read up on their services online and therefore entice them to use and take
                    interest in their product or service. Accessing the web in 2020 is a basic human right. Important
                    resources like educational videos, banking services and social sites should be accessible to all
                    people. There are many ways to make a site accessible. Adding alternative text to an image is one
                    small way to make a site more accessible. For example, an image of a cat could have alternative text
                    that says “An image of a cat”. This means that when a blind person is navigating a site using screen
                    readers, the images are described. For users that cannot use a mouse, making a website accessible
                    through the use of the keyboard is essential. For deaf users, transcripts for audio aspects of your
                    site is important. For dyslexic users, making sure that fonts used are easy to read is good
                    practise. For colour blind users, a website with colours that have enough contrast to be visible.
                    Creating a website that is accessible can be as simple as adding a bit more functionality and
                    changing your font and colours.
