                    Sadie Garner is a 21-year-old aspiring crime writer living in Johannesburg in 1995. She was born in
                    Edenvale. She is a short, blonde girl. She originally wanted to be a policewoman, but decided she
                    was too small to be able to overpower criminals. She then figured that she should still try to solve
                    crimes from afar through crime writing. As a prolific serial killer begins to terrorise
                    Johannesburg, she decides she would take matters into her own hands by writing a book on the
                    supposedly linked killings. She created a website in order to keep track of her thoughts, while also
                    hoping someone would be able to contact her with more information. Her website gains popularity when
                    a press release confirms all her thoughts about the killer. She gained an interest in true crime
                    when an acquaintance in her school was kidnapped in 1990. The girl was walking home from school when
                    a man and wife in a van grabbed her. There was only one witness. Jan Burger was the chief detective
                    on the case and solved it. The girl’s body was found a month later. Burger is Sadie’s role model.
                    Her goal in life is to be able to meet him and discuss every detail of his life. Sadie is a bubbly
                    girl, who is close with her family. She wrote for the school newspaper. She got an internship at the
                    Edenvale news but quit because she found most of the stories she had to write were very mundane. She
                    is unemployed but hopes to become a writer for a South African crime magazine.
