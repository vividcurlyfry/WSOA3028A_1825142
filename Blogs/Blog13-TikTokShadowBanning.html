    onload="LoadBlogPost('Tik Tok Shadow Banning Black Creators',` <p>I have spent a lot of time on Tik Tok during lockdown. For me, I found it to be a really good time to join the platform. I only joined at the beginning of lockdown out of boredom. Then, I discovered Tik Tok has an amazing community of people that make me feel welcomed and entertained. I strongly follow the news of the BLM protests, and so many creators I see on my For You Page are people speaking out and taking part in the protests.</p><h3>How does the Tik Tok algorithm work?</h3><p>Tik Tok shows a small number of users a video that has been uploaded. The algorithm then measures how many likes, shares and comments the video gets. The algorithm’s “sweet spot” is one like for every 10 views. “Content that gets less than that 1/10 like to view ratio will stop growing” [1]. This Tik Tok algorithm works in favour of small creators, as if you get a like to view ratio of 1/10, your videos will appear on the For You Page more. This means that even if you do not have a lot of followers to give you a lot of views, your video will still be shared. Watch time is also imperative for a video to be successful. If people watch your video the whole way through, the algorithm is more likely to show your video to more people. Watch time takes up a large weight of the algorithm, and is the most important thing to determine success for your videos. Other factors that determine the success of a video are captions and hashtags.</p><h3>Tik Tok has become a place for social change:</h3><p>Just the other day, Tik Tok was the reason behind causing a Trump rally, which was being held on Juneteeth, to have 6 200 people attended, which was one third of the capacity of the stadium. </p><p> Tik Tok is now “serving as a hub for #blacklivesmatter activism” [2].</p><p>So, now that we know how the Tik Tok algorithm works, let’s talk about the censorship that has been taking place on Tik Tok, specifically against the Black Lives Matter movement.</p><p>The BLM Hashtag: <p><img class=&quot pictureRow &quot src=&quot /WSOA3028A_1825142/Theory/BLM1.png &quot alt= &quot Screenshot of a tweet &quot height=500rem><img class=&quot pictureRow &quot src=&quot /WSOA3028A_1825142/Theory/BLM2.png &quot alt= &quot Screenshot of a tweet &quot height=500rem><img class=&quot pictureRow &quot src=&quot /WSOA3028A_1825142/Theory/BLM3.png &quot alt= &quot Screenshot of a tweet &quot height=500rem></p>In this tweet, it can be seen that Tik Tok blocked all Black Lives Matter tags and all tags related to George Floyd. Tik Tok claims that this was just a glitch. Tik Tok, a Chinese company, has been known to block posts relating to the Hong Kong protests [3], so I do not believe that this is a valid reason.</p><p>As mentioned before, hashtags can increase the reach of your video. If someone is not able to tag a video with “Black Lives Matter” how can that video gain reach?</p><h3>So what is Shadow Banning?</h3><p>Shadow banning refers to the banning of content with the creator being unaware. A creator will have a lot of reach and views before being shadow banned, and then they will suddenly have much less views on their more recent videos than before. A shadow banned user’s videos won’t appear on the For You Page as much.</p><p>The thing is, there is no real proof that shadow banning is ACTUALLY happening on Tik Tok. This is the issue, the creators who are being shadow banned cannot prove it. Therefore, Tik Tok doesn’t need to do anything about it because they aren’t actually obviously doing anything wrong.</p><h3>How can you help Shadowbanned creators?</h3><p>SHARE -> COPY LINK! When you see a creator on your Tik Tok and they say they are Shadowbanned, it is really useful to Share their video, and if you don’t want to spam your friends with videos, sharing and copying the link will do just fine. Also, ALWAYS watch the whole video through! This will help the algorithm share the video. </p>`, `<p><cite>[1] S. Williams, \“Understanding the TikTok Algorithm,”\ 13 02 2020. [Online].
