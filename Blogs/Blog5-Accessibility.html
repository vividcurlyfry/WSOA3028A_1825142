By accessible, I mean that the people with disabilities are not excluded when accessing a website. Websites should be easy and convenient for all people to use. People who are colour-blind, dyslexic, blind etc. should be able to use a site with ease. Businesses can even benefit from making their sites accessible as they are allowing more people to be able to read up on their services online and therefore entice them to use and take interest in their product or service. Accessing the web in 2020 is a basic human right. Important resources like educational videos, banking services and social sites should be accessible to all people. There are many ways to make a site accessible. Adding alternative text to an image is one small way to make a site more accessible. For example, an image of a cat could have alternative text that says  &quotAn image of a cat &quot. This means that when a blind person is navigating a site using screen readers, the images are described. For users that cannot use a mouse, making a website accessible through the use of the keyboard is essential. For deaf users, transcripts for audio aspects of your site is important. For dyslexic users, making sure that fonts used are easy to read is good practise. For colour blind users, a website with colours that have enough contrast to be visible. Creating a website that is accessible can be as simple as adding a bit more functionality and changing your font and colours.', '','Blogs/Blog5-Accessibility.html')">
