    onload="LoadBlogPost('Var, Let and Const',` <p>When I first heard about Javascript, I was a bit freaked out. For var, let and const, the variable declarers, there is no need to declare any types. I don’t like this. It makes me suspicious.  I didn’t like the sound of not declaring variable types explicitly. I haven’t don’t much work  in javascript as of late, to be fair, but after working in Python I have discovered this is the bane of my existence.<p>Let’s talk about var. Var is globally scoped, which means it can be used anywhere if declared outside of a function. I was also told in my software development course last year that using global variables will fail me. So… I still hate you, var. Var is sexy because it can be redeclared and updated throughout the file. This can be nasty though because you may change it by mistake along the way without realising. I understand that you should be able to update a variable, but redeclare it??? Illegal. Jailtime.</p><p>Let is var’s older and cooler sister. She started the hashtag #VarIsOverParty. No one likes var anymore. BIG DEAL WITH LET: YOU CAN’T REDECLARE HER!!! She knows who she is. She owns it (love that for her). She is also declared in a block. This means that its not a global variable, which means I won’t fail software development (love that for ME). Let will only exist in its scope and therefore variable names can be reused in different functions without being redeclared.</p> <p>CONST!!! The baddest girl in this town. Except she’s stubborn. Const is block scoped and CANNOT be redeclared or updated. She must be initialized when she is declared. I feel like this is the most stable of the three sisters. </p> <p>Anyway, that’s my beef with Javascript. Thanks for coming to my ted talk. I wrote this late at night. I am sorry. I hope it still counts for something. Please rate and subscribe.</p>`, '', 'Blogs/Blog7-Javascript.html'); generateNav()">
