                    Browsers are software that allow for websites to be displayed to users. Browsers allow for people to
                    navigate through the internet. Browser functionality consists of four major sections: Fetch,
                    Process, Display, Storage [1]. A browser will use a URL to fetch resources from the internet. It is
                    important that the user has a good enough network to fetch data. The browser will then process this
                    data. For example, code will be executed, and optimisation will occur. This data will then be
                    displayed to the user using the User Interface. “The User Interface (UI) communicates with other
                    subsystems within the browser to display content and act accordingly” [1]. The browser will then
                    store a small amount of data in order to make the user’s experience faster and more convenient, such
                    as storing what websites a user has interacted with in a previous session.
                    URLs are used to navigate on a browser. URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. You enter a URL
                    into the browser, and a website will load if that URL exists. A URL has the name of the protocol
                    needed to access the site, as well as the IP address or domain name [2]. Other parts that a URL can
                    include are the path, which refers to “the file or location on the web server” [2] and a fragment,
                    which is an internal reference to a page in the website. URLs can be shortened. A redirect page with
                    a shortened URL can be used in order to make it easier for people to access a page, although this
                    may cause the page to become susceptible to malware.
