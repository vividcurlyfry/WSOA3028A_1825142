    onload="LoadBlogPost('Creative Brainstorm','When trying to make up a serial killer, I am trying not to be too insensitive. The ABC Killer (Moses Sithole) is the biggest serial killer in South Africa, who murdered at least 38 people. He was called the ABC Killer because he killed in Atteridgeville, Boksburg and Cleveland. Tamsen de Beer (a journalist) was called by Sithole. Sithole identified himself as the ABC Killer and had to tell her where a body was to confirm he was the killer. Sithole murdered women with their own clothes, which was a very clear Modus Operandi. He told women that he had job prospects for them and would lead them away. This is an interesting story and initially I was going to put myself in the place of de Beer, but decided against it. I want to be able to have some creative freedom when creating this killer. I still want this website to be from a crime writer who helps solve a crime. An obvious example of this is Michelle Mcnamara, a crime writer who wrote a book about the East Area Rapist, who she later coined the Golden State Killer. She helped essentially solve the case by creating the name Golden State Killer which created more publicity for the unsolved crime.  I want to have Sadie Garner be a writer like Michelle Mcnamara who helps coin the name of the killer. Another Johannesburg killer is Cedric Maake. His case is super interesting because initially, two criminal profiles were created for him because of the different MOs. He shot women, bludgeoned couples to death with rocks and killed tailors with hammers. The two different profiles were eventually connected when evidence began to overlap. I think I want to create a killer with no clear MO. I also want Sadie Garner to coin the name and make the connection between initially unconnected cases.', ''); generateNav()">
