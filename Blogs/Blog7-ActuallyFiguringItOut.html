    onload="LoadBlogPost('Actually Figuring It Out','HUGE IDEA! I finally figured out what I want to do with the creative side of the site. When watching the show Mindhunter, a large part of season two was about the Child Atlanta murders. 28 people, mostly children and adolescents, were murdered. This happened in the late 70s and early 80s. I don’t know a lot of details of the real case, but the show was interesting and has inspired me. I think this will be far easier to write a story about and base it in Johannesburg especially. The issue with the cases is that the police basically didn’t care about these missing black children. The murders were written off as drug or gang related and dismissed. It wasn’t put together that there was a serial killer at large until a few months later, I think. This is a clear example of the racism that is and was present in the police force. I think this can largely be applied to a story set in South Africa. There will be many children that are dying, the deaths of which weren’t connected until much later on. This will still tie in to what I want where Sadie links that there is a serial killer present, but also highlight racism in the country. I have used an AI generator to get pictures of young black children to be the victims and I have made up some names. I will come up with a story for each victim and Sadie will be the one who theorises that there is one person behind all this. I feel much happier about this idea as I will not be talking about real killings. I had a fear that when talking about the ABC killings that I was not going to do the story justice. The most important part of the story will be the fact that the police are doing nothing to solve the case. I would also like to compare the publicity of kidnappings of white children in South Africa to these made up cases. More research needs to be done in order to create a proper narrative.', '','Blogs/Blog7-ActuallyFiguringItOut.html')">
